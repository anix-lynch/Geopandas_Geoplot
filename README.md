# 🗺️ GeoExplorer: Exploring Geospatial Data Using GeoPandas, Geoplot, and Contextily

Welcome to **GeoExplorer**! In this project, we’ll explore geospatial data using Python libraries like GeoPandas, Geoplot, and Contextily. We’ll work with various geospatial data types such as points, lines, and polygons and visualize them on both basic and advanced maps. Let’s dive into the fascinating world of geospatial data visualization! 🌍🗺️

## 🌐 Project Overview

Geospatial data is essential for understanding geographic relationships and patterns. In this project, we’ll read and process geospatial datasets using GeoPandas and visualize them using Geoplot and Contextily. We’ll create various types of maps, including basic maps, stacked maps, choropleths, kernel density maps, and cartograms. Additionally, we’ll explore the use of tile layers to enhance map backgrounds with Contextily, and build interactive web maps with Geoplot and Folium.
